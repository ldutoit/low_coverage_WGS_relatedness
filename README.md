# Low coverage WGS relatedness

This repository describes a simple pipeline for inferring relatedness in low-coverage whole-genome sequencing data  of non-model species.

The working pipeline presented is outlined in this [Quick Guide](QuickGuide.md) and intended to provide a base from which analyses could be built.

The code creating the foundation for estimating relatedness from low-coverage whole-genome re-sequencing data is provided in [lowcov_pipeline.md](lowcov_pipeline.md)
