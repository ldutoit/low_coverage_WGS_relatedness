# Low coverage WGS relatedness

This repository describes a simple pipeline for inferring relatedness in low-coverage whole-genome resequencing data  of non-model species.

- The working pipeline presented is outlined in this [Quick Guide](QuickGuide.md) and intended to provide a base from which analyses could be built.

- The code creating the foundation for estimating relatedness from low-coverage whole-genome resequencing data is provided in [lowcov_pipeline.md](lowcov_pipeline.md)
